1. brighter light means more saturation and diffraction around sharp features
2. lower brightness used for teh usaf target for this reason
3. camera and eyepiece see images the same way up
4. higher mag lenses were getting dimmer ... even though the NA was increasing
5. the usaf target had to be kept on a blank slide since it wasnt fitting in the slot
