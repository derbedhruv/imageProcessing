    Reverse FPM trials using MATLAB
    Author: Dhruv Joshi

    The idea here is to test out the FPM algorithm (and interesting ideas
    using it) by chopping a high-res image (from the internet, not owned by
    me) into smaller pieces and therefore being able to reconstruct it
    using FPM. This should validate the whole algo.
