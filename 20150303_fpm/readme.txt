4,4 was the centre one .. approx, but mostly in the center so normal illumination, this was confirmed by looking through the microscope to make sure the circular-ness of the LED was mostly completely in the FOV.

same 2x objective used.

0,0 on the top right. The tripod's single leg pointing towards self. The written part of the 8x8 mini red array pointing backwards.

mega used to control the LED array.

7,7 on the bottom left, but the bottomest row not worknig. 

nomenclature of files as xy.jpg where x,y illumination. was used to generate it. All images were 20810x1542

THE IMAGES WERE INVERTED IN BOTH AXES - SO BOTTOM RIGHT IN REAL LIFE IS TOP LEFT IN THE IMAGES

Questions:
1. what about nonuniform/diffrential illumination? Check out 32 for exdample.. this is obv going to happen since we are obliquely illuminating.
2.
